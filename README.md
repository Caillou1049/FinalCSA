# Capstone Project

### By: Ryan Tiedeman


Got bored of writing test cases, so it probably works, not 100% sure.

Hopefully you've enjoyed trying understanding whatever I wrote. There is about 40 different ways I think I could of wrote this better. But I decided that refactoring the code would make it look like I know what im doing, and copy and pasting is just easier (tester).

And you thought I wouldn't do the project...
